Coursera Data Science Project

Description

Often when entering text into a mobile telephone or other handheld device, your are prompted with a likely next word. This is the jist of this application. The user will supply a partial phrase or sentence and the application will provide its best guess for the next word.

Data Set

The SwiftKey data set used to make this application consists of samples taken from three sources, the news, blogs and twitter messages. The data set is huge and must be rendered into a usable form that is both timely and compact.

Application

The application uses this data to predict the next word in a phrase. The method used for this prediction relies on a history of previous phrase fragments, known as Ngrams, to accomplish this. The application searches through the data and determines the next word based on statistical likelihood.
